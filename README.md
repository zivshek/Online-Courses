# Coursework like homework and quizzes and tests for all online courses

## Courses I've taken and plan to take

Courses | Platform | Duration | Effort | My Thoughts
:-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--
[Programming Languages, Part A](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages) | Coursera | 5 weeks | 4-8 hrs/w | Beyond fantastic! Don't let the initial setup scare you, I know it's a new unheard language, but once you started the actual course, you won't regret. Extremely well structured and delievered.
